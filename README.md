WEEK 12 PROJECT

Meet The Team

HELLO!

About Our Project

PROBLEM DOMAIN

Travel agent websites are SO boringâ€¦

â€¦so we created a travel agent brand for holiday goers, with a fun website where users can create an account, enquire about holiday packages, leave reviews, and a whole host of other fun things, which you will soon see!

User Stories

MVP

-  want to be able to sign up to the website and have my own username & bio.

- I want to be able to view the holiday packages available from the travel agent website.

- I want to be able to leave a review using a form which displays on a page & shows all users reviews.

User Stories

STRETCH GOALS

- I want to view my bio & all of my own reviews on â€˜My Profileâ€™ page.

- I want to hear a recommended playlist, curated for the destination & length of my flight, to get me in the holiday mood.

- I want to be able to use a Live Chat function to contact the agent.

- I want to be able to play a game on the website and collect points towards my holiday.

Planning

Trello

We assigned actions and planned out the process and requirements for our project using Trello.

We also used this to share quick links to shared resources.

Wireframe & Schema

We planned how our website & database schema would look using Figma to create a wireframe.

Demo Time!

PLEASE FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS & PREPARE FOR TAKE OFFâ€¦

Features

LIVE CHAT

- We implemented a live chat feature using HubSpot.


- This was coded into our â€˜Contact Usâ€™ page and allows visitors to the website to send a message in real time and receive a response from an actual human - wow!


- Reference: https://app-eu1.hubspot.com

  Features

  SPOTIFY

- We curated four playlists with songs related to the holiday destination, which display on the package pages.

- You can interact with the playlist on our website, or you can save it to your own favourites on Spotify if you have an account.


- The playlist length covers the full duration of the flight so screaming children can be a thing of the past (unless theyâ€™re your ownâ€¦)

Not Quite A Featureâ€¦

ELEVATOR .JS

- Elevator.js is an NPM package which creates a "back to top" button that glides you smoothly from the bottom to the top of the page.

- We implemented the scroll, but wanted to use custom music to play during the elevation to suit the theme of the holiday package - BUTâ€¦ this doesnâ€™t work in Next.js - BOO.

- SO, undeterred, we created our own, BETTER version called MELEVATOR!

- Reference: tholman.com/elevator.js [Donâ€™t use this, use Melevator in our GitHub ðŸ˜‰ ]

Features

GITAWAY POINTS GAME

- We created a fun game where you can collect â€˜GITAWAYâ€™ points.

- In a future release, we would like to implement a feature that allows the points to be stored and displayed on the â€˜My Profileâ€™ page.

Lighthouse & ACCESSIBILITY

MOBILE RESPONSIVE

The website is accessible and can be used on mobile and desktop devices.

KEYBOARD FUNCTIONALITY

The website can be navigated with a keyboard without the need for a mouse.

LIGHTHOUSE SCORE

Performance: 94
Accessibility: 100
Best Practices: 78
SEO: 100

BACK TO TOP FUNCTION

On pages with a lot of content, we have simplified accessibility by having a scroll to top button.

Evaluation

Collaboration & Principles

- We agreed on the theme & created the Trello board, Github Framework, User Stories, DB Schema & Wireframe as a basis for the project.

- We used â€˜Live Shareâ€™ to pair programme together & regularly updated GitHub.

- We communicated and shared our screens regularly to keep each other updated on progress and blockers.

Collaboration & Principles

- We started each day with an informal catch up, then on to a â€˜stand upâ€™ to agree the goals and a plan to address any blockers.

- We agreed a comms plan to keep each other informed of our availability & what to do in an unexpected circumstance.

- We protected the â€˜mainâ€™ branch and set up a review system to authorise any changes before merging & independently resolved any merge conflicts.

Reflections

- We had a solid plan in place before we started coding, and managed our expectations for the project - prioritising the MVP and mark scheme criteria before dabbling with the more exciting stretch elements.

- We could have worked more efficiently by conducting more research at the start - such as checking whether Elevator.js would be compatible, before spending excess time trying to force it to work - sadly, code doesnâ€™t work like thatâ€¦

- Working together and coaching each other through elements we were each less confident with has been really rewarding - all of us feel that we have come away from this project with more skills than when we started.

Reflections

- We had fun implementing third party additions such as Toast, to create the pop up when you add a new review, and the live chat feature.

- With more time, we would have liked to implement more interactivity in the navigation menu & additional Radix components. We also encountered an issue where a refresh is required when logging in for first time for the page to show the username and bio required form - we are looking into how to fix this.

- We thoroughly enjoyed working together and feel really proud of what we have accomplished, especially as this was a pivot project that only started on Monday afternoon (but we donâ€™t talk about that!!) <3
